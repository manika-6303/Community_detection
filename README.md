Detects community in karate as well as dolphins dataset using Particle-Swarm optimization algorithm and kmeans-clustering
Multi-objective community detection is a technique used to identify communities or clusters in a
network, where multiple objectives or criteria are considered simultaneously. These objectives can
include factors such as network modularity, edge density, node similarity, and community size
balance.

The goal of multi-objective community detection is to find a set of solutions, known as the Pareto-
optimal set, that represents the best trade-offs between the different objectives. These solutions are

not dominated by any other solutions in the set, meaning that no other solution performs better in
all objectives simultaneously. Multi-objective community detection has applications in various
fields, such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and transportation network analysis. It can
help identify meaningful communities in a network that have different characteristics and can be
used for various purposes.
